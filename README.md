# Cloth-Simulation
A simple OpenGL cloth simulation that reacts to gravity and wind forces. 
## Features implemented 
- Particle object
  - Updating position using verlet integration
- Spring constraints between two particles
- Cloth mesh that contains array of particle

## What I learned
- Understood the fundamentals of physical simulation. Such as time steps, particles, and their interactions between other objects.

## What to improve
- Implement other means of updating the positions of the particles, either with transform feedback or compute shader.
