# Cloth-Simulation
An Android OpenGL project that focued on cubemap reflection. Reflection's based on sample cubemap or personal cubemap taken with the camera. After researching, I figured it would be cumbersome to implement 360 picture taker. So I decied to layout 6 camera previews that maps to a cubemap.
